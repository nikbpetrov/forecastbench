"""End-to-end: one offline run of the whole ForecastBench data flow, checked at every stage.

Mimics the nightly pipeline with no GCP and no network, across multiple sources and stages,
parameterized by scenario so behaviour is asserted *throughout*:

    bucket update (polymarket) + seeded banks (metaculus, fred)
        → explode_question_set → resolve_all → impute → leaderboard scoring/ordering

The sources are deliberately heterogeneous:
- polymarket — an OPEN market resolved through a real ``local_bucket`` round-trip (its ``update``
  driver). Open markets resolve to a tracked value but ``resolved=False``, so the leaderboard
  correctly excludes them — we assert that.
- metaculus — a RESOLVED market (binary 0/1), which the leaderboard scores.
- fred — a dataset source with two resolution dates (resolves to 1.0 / 0.0), also scored.

The ``nullified`` parameter adds a nullified polymarket question and asserts it is dropped end to
end. Narrow seam behaviours live in ``integration/``; per-stage edge cases live in ``unit/`` —
this asserts the stages compose.
