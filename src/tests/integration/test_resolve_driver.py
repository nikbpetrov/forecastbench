"""Integration: the ``func_resolve`` driver() — raw forecast set → processed forecast set.

Runs the real ``orchestration/func_resolve/main.py:driver()`` against a ``local_bucket``: it lists
the raw forecast files, downloads + resolves the question set, imputes missing forecasts, and writes
the processed file the leaderboard later consumes. This is the round-trip the resolution e2e skips by
hand-building frames — here the *driver* orchestrates it.

Only the GCP/git-coupled seams are patched; everything between is the real code path:
- ``_io.load_question_bank`` — raises on a GCS freshness check in prod → return a built bank.
- ``_io.upload_resolution_set`` — git-pushes the public resolution set → mock.
- ``_io.load_hash_mapping`` — reads ``<source>/hash_mapping.json`` from GCS (and leaves a stale
  ``/tmp`` copy on a miss) → return ``""`` so the run is hermetic.
- ``slack.send_message`` — posts market-resolution warnings → mock.
