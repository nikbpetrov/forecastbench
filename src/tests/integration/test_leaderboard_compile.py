"""Integration: the leaderboard's read → filter → compile seam against a ``local_bucket``.

``download_and_compile_processed_forecast_files`` is the leaderboard's intake: it lists the processed
forecast bucket, drops dates that are too recent or whose **Naive Forecaster** file has too few
resolved questions, then compiles each remaining *eligible* file through ``get_df_info`` into a
leaderboard entry keyed by ``question_pk``. The resolution e2e skips this by hand-building frames;
here we drive the real intake over seeded processed files (the artifacts ``func_resolve`` writes).

``MIN_NUM_DATASET_QUESTIONS`` (225 in prod) is patched small so a tiny fixture exercises the path.
