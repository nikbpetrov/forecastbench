"""Contract: resolution is fail-fast and nullification-safe for every market source.

Registry-parametrized over ``MARKET_SOURCES`` (all implemented on this branch). These assert the
*real* guarantees of the resolve path rather than inventing tolerant behavior:

- a question id absent from ``dfr`` raises (``_validate_ids``) — resolution never fabricates a
  value for a question it has no data for;
- an unknown source raises in ``resolve_all`` rather than silently skipping;
- a nullified question is dropped from the resolved output regardless of siblings.

Dataset sources also call ``_validate_ids`` but have different value semantics, so they get their
own cases rather than being forced through this market-shaped harness.
