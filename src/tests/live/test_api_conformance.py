"""Live API conformance — opt-in drift detection (NOT run in PR CI).

Every test here is marked ``@pytest.mark.live``, so it is excluded by the default
``addopts = -m 'not live'`` and the no-network / fake-secrets guards are lifted. Run it on a
schedule or manually::

    make test ARGS="-m live"

**Approach: call the source's own request methods and validate their output**, rather than
re-building the requests in the test. A dropped/renamed field then surfaces through the real code
path — usually as a ``KeyError`` inside the source's parser (``_transform_question``,
``_is_market_binary``, the search-endpoint filter) — so there is nothing to keep in sync. We call
the granular private methods (``_call_search_endpoint``, ``_get_market``,
``_fetch_questions_from_api``, ``_fetch_historical_prices``, ``_get_sp500_tickers``), never the
heavyweight public ``fetch()``/``update()`` (full pagination + per-item network + sleeps).

The lone re-created request is Polymarket *discovery*: its real method paginates every active
market with per-page sleeps and per-market CLOB calls, so we issue one bounded Gamma request and
then route the markets through the real static parsers.

Keyless endpoints (polymarket, manifold, yfinance via Yahoo + Wikipedia) always run. Keyed
endpoints (metaculus, infer) get their API key from ``helpers.keys`` via ``_resolve_secret_or_skip``
— a real Secret Manager lookup once the fake-secrets guard is lifted — and *skip* (not fail) when
no credential is available (local dev / CI without GCP). That helper is the single seam to extend
later with other providers (e.g. a ``.env`` fallback). Live tests only read; they never write.
