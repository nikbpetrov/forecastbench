"""Golden-file (snapshot / approval) regression helper for the e2e suite.

A *golden* freezes the canonical output of a pipeline run. The e2e test computes a result,
canonicalizes it (optional stable column subset, sorted by a key, numerics rounded), and asserts
it equals the committed golden. This is the catch-all net: it flags *any* drift the explicit
semantic asserts didn't anticipate.

The **check** runs as part of ``make test`` (offline, deterministic, CI-gating). Regenerating
("re-blessing") the goldens is a deliberate dev step, **never** CI:

    UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 make test                       # rewrite every golden
    UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 make test ARGS="src/tests/e2e"  # just the e2e goldens

The regenerated CSV shows up as a reviewable diff in the PR — that diff *is* the review artifact
("you changed these leaderboard rows — intended?"). Goldens pin "what is", not "what's correct",
so the e2e keeps its intent-revealing asserts alongside them: a wrong re-bless is still caught by a
failing semantic assertion. Determinism is the whole ballgame — only freeze frames produced under
``freeze_today`` + seeded RNG + a stable sort key, or the goldens flap.

CSV is used on purpose: the PR diff must be human-readable. (Note ``.gitignore`` blanket-ignores
``*.csv``; ``src/tests/golden/**/*.csv`` is un-ignored so goldens are committed.)

Two caveats: (1) ``key`` must uniquely identify rows — this is *enforced*, else a reorder could
hide under the sort; (2) the CSV round-trip normalizes object columns via ``read_csv`` inference
(leading-zero string IDs, empty-string vs null), so it can mask format-only drift there — prefer
scalar columns and freeze ID-like columns deliberately.
