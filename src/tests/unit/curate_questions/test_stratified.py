"""Unit tests for the market stratification engine (the most bug-prone curate logic).

The e2e fixtures collapse every market into a *single* composite bin, so cross-bin allocation,
``min(target, available)`` capping, the rounding-adjustment loop, and per-bin decorrelation are
never exercised end-to-end. These tests build a genuinely multi-bin ``dfq`` (>=2 market-value bins
x >=2 time-horizon bins) and pin the engine's *semantics* (counts / weights / capping /
reproducibility) rather than baking selected ids into a golden.

Time-horizon bins are reachable only relative to ``question_curation.FORECAST_DATETIME`` (which is
derived from ``FREEZE_DATETIME`` at import), so close datetimes here are always computed as an
offset from that anchor instead of hardcoded — keeping the tests date-independent.
