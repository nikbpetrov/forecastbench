"""Unit tests for the leaderboard's published-artifact serializers.

``unit/leaderboard/`` already covers the scoring math; these cover the *output* layer — the JS files
the website consumes. Both serializers are pure (DataFrame in → ``{filename, js}`` out), so we assert
the artifact contract: correct per-type filename, the rows embedded, and the compact view's
anonymous-submission filtering. (The JS is not golden-frozen: ``LAST_UPDATED_DATE`` is import-time
nondeterministic, so we assert structure, not bytes.)
