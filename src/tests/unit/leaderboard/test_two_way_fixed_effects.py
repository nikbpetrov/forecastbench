"""The real leaderboard ranking method: 2FE difficulty-adjusted Brier + bootstrap, on a real-shaped
fixture.

The other ``unit/leaderboard`` tests use the non-regression scorers because ``pyfixest`` is
degenerate on tiny input. This exercises the production scoring path —
``score_models([two_way_fixed_effects, peer_score, brier_skill_score], …)`` and
``generate_simulated_leaderboards`` — on a ~225-dataset / 50-market fixture carrying the four
baselines, then **goldens** the scored frame. Scope is ``score_models`` + the bootstrap in
isolation; NOT ``make_leaderboard``/``driver``, which write buckets and git-push the site.
